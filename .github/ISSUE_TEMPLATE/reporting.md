Just so you know, this is not a user support helpdesk.

We ask that you please use this interface to contribute constructively to this free, open-source project by reporting carefully tested problems that you find in the software. Please provide as much information as possible and include a small test case which allows developers to reproduce the issue.

For user support, please direct questions to the [forum](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=37&sid=3d90858d2ff441bd10475a693b55643a). [This post](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=33492&sid=49653315f6743c97b2e41708d8414b76) may contain useful information.

This is a community, open-source project and we, unfortunately, do not have the resources to provide a support service.
